# 2010.09.29 SF Selenium Meetup Presentation: Introduction to JavaScript testing with Jasmine

I gave this presentation at the [SFSe Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/seleniumsanfrancisco/calendar/14688689/) on September 29, 2010.

This presentation is an HTML file (with some supporting directories).  Clone this repo locally and open the HTML file in your browser of choice (though it works best in Chrome, Safari or FireFox).

Thx,
